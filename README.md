# IllumioCodingChallenge

Hello! This is my submission to the coding challenge. Firewall.py contains my implementation of the class, along with 2 helper functions.

Include a README file, which includes anything you’d like to communicate to the person
that is reviewing your code. This may include items such as:
a. how you tested your solution
b. any interesting coding, design, or algorithmic choices you’d like to point out
c. any refinements or optimizations that you would’ve implemented if you had
more time
d. anything else you’d like the reviewer to know
3. Include in your README file the particular area of the team that you’re interested in.
Descriptions of the three areas can be found on the next page. If you’re interested in
more than one area and/or have a ranking, please let us know!
